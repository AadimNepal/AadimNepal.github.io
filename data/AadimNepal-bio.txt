Outside of computer science, I am defined by my curiosity and competitiveness. My academic journey began in computational biology, where I worked on drug discovery with Dr. Pramod Aryal at an agricultural startup in Southern Nepal. I tend to learn by intuition, grasping the big picture first and then "brute-forcing" the details.

I previously debated for my country’s National Team, and I remain active as a member of the NYUAD swim and tennis teams. I love sports and adventure, and I have been lucky enough to travel to over 25 countries.
